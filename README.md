**SGPA Calculator Web App**

**Description:**

The SGPA Calculator Web App is a simple and user-friendly tool that allows students to calculate their Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA) based on their subject grades and credits. It helps students in engineering and other academic disciplines to easily determine their SGPA, an important metric used to assess academic performance.

**Key Features:**

1. **User-Friendly Interface:** The web app provides an intuitive and easy-to-use interface, making it accessible to all students.

2. **Semester Selection:** Users can select the desired semester (Semester 2 or Semester 4) for which they want to calculate the SGPA.

3. **Dynamic Form:** The form dynamically populates with subjects and grade options based on the selected semester. Users can choose grades from the drop-down menu.

4. **Grading Scale:** The app incorporates a predefined grading scale, enabling the conversion of letter grades to grade points.

5. **SGPA Calculation:** Upon selecting grades for all subjects, users can click the "Get SGPA" button to calculate their SGPA for the chosen semester.

6. **Data Storage:** The app stores SGPA results in a CSV-like format on the client side, enabling the admin to access and review students' SGPA data. (Note: The data is stored locally on the user's browser and is accessible only to the admin.)

7. **Join Us / Contact Us:** The footer includes a "Join Us / Contact Us" button that redirects users to a WhatsApp group link to connect with the app's team.

**Usage Instructions:**

1. Select the desired semester (Semester 2 or Semester 4) for which you want to calculate the SGPA.

2. Fill in the grade options for each subject based on the provided grading scale.

3. Click the "Get SGPA" button to calculate your SGPA for the chosen semester.

**Technical Details:**

The SGPA Calculator Web App is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses a dynamic form generation mechanism to populate subjects and grade options for the selected semester. The app employs a predefined grading scale to convert letter grades to grade points for SGPA calculation. Additionally, it saves SGPA results in a CSV-like format on the client side, allowing the admin to access the data.

**Note:**

This web app is meant for educational and demonstration purposes. It currently stores SGPA data locally on the user's browser and does not involve any server-side storage or user authentication. For more robust and secure data storage, consider implementing backend functionalities.
